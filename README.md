# Expense-Recorder
I have created a comprehensive application for tracking daily expenses, utilizing a microservices architecture for scalability and modularity. The project incorporates clean code practices and design patterns to ensure maintainability and extensibility. Additionally, the frontend is developed with Angular to provide a seamless user experience.
